# draggable-elements-module-js
The javascript that powers my KTWP Draggable Elements WordPress plugin, at https://github.com/kupietools/ktwp-wp-plugin-draggable-elements, repackaged as an ES module for general javascript use. 

I'll get this documented shortly, but for now, the main file of my WP Draggable Elements plugin shows the config that needs to be passed to it. This may be a version or two behind that as of this writing. 

Besides seeing the WordPress version live on my website at https://michaelkupietz.com, you can see this module in use in a demo at https://codepen.io/kupietz/pen/LEpzJgL .
